# Reversing encoded shellcode [IDA debugging, tiny_tracer, structures_applying]<br/>

In this video I will be showing encoded shellcode reversing in IDA with help of new feature of tiny_tracer tool.<br/>
You can see very often used methods in shellcode to resolve API function addresses via parsing TEB, PEB, Export directory structures and others...<br/>
This covers - Generating shellcode, converting shellcode to exe, IDA debugging, applying structures in IDA, using tiny_tracer, cports tool.<br/>
