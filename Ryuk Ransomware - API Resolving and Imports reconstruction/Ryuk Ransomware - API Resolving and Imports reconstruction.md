## Ryuk Ransomware - Advanced using of Scylla for Imports reconstruction<br/>
This video covers Imports rebuilding using well known tool Scylla.

It shows how one can use combination of tools - IDA + x64dbg + the ScyllaÂ´s not
only the build in feature as IAT Autosearch (Normal vs Advanced) which in some
situations like this does not work. You will learn how to use Scylla to specify
memory address range of IAT where Dynamically resolved API function addresses
are populated during the runtime.

As an example the Ryuk Ransomware sample is used. This guide can serve also for
other samples where we have to properly set the Scylla tool and not only using
the default searching feature for IAT reconstruction.
